# Zafumix icons 
I really like the Zafiro icon set (https://github.com/zayronxio/Zafiro-icons) for apps but I don't like their folders. I really like the Numix (https://github.com/numixproject) folders, so here's a combination of the Numix 2023 onwards folders and Zafiro applications icons. I run Gnome on Debian and and Gnome on Arch so I know it works with those configurations. Haven't tried it with any other distros and desktop environments. 

This only has the Numix default folder colors. If you want the other colors, check this out https://github.com/joaoatienza/zafumix-icons

This repo only exists so that I can just run one command and get my set up looking how I like it without downloading other stuff I'm not gonna use.

### Installing the icons

   - Navigate to `~/.local/share/icons` (in user mode) or `/usr/share/icons` (in root mode) and run `git clone https://github.com/joaoatienza/zafumix-icons-default.git`
