# Zafumix icons 
I really like the Zafiro icon set for apps but I don't like their folders. I really like the Numix folders so here's a combination. I run Gnome so I know it works with that. Haven't tried it with any other desktop environments. 

This only has the Numix default folder colors. If you want the other colors, check this out https://github.com/joaoatienza/zafumix-icons

This repo only exists so that I can just run one command and get my set up looking how I like it without downloading other stuff I'm not gonna use.

### Installing the icons

   - Navigate to `~/.local/share/icons` (in user mode) or `/usr/share/icons` (in root mode) and run `git clone https://github.com/joaoatienza/zafumix-icons-default.git`
